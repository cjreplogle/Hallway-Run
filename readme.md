This game was made by CJ Replogle in the Brackets IDE for AP Computer Science Principles.
It's main function was to help learn the basics of Javascript and game development. For
this reason the game has plenty of bugs and isn't what you would call the perfect game.
Sprites are made by myself and sounds were taken from an open sound effects site and
modified. Either way its different enough I think it should fall under fair use if the
sounds weren't public domain in the first place. The gamefunctions_v4.js file was an
engine for collision detection and input listeners among other things made by my teacher,
Mike Thomas. This game, along with a poster I made got a 4 on the exam which I believe 
was actually the highest score of anyone in my class for the 2020 year. Either way, here's
the game, and if my github ever blows up in the years to come feel free to look back here
and know that everyone starts somewhere.
